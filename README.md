Hi, I'm Takeshi-Sakamoto5.

I explore what can be built through pure natural-language interaction with advanced AIs.

PolyAgora — my main project — was created during a two-day trip, entirely through conversation with GPT-5.1. No code, no plan; just iterative dialogue and emergent structure.

I'm interested in:
- multi-agent systems  
- natural-language OS design  
- conversational architecture  
- emergent behavior in AI  
- human–AI co-creation  

Currently experimenting with:
- natural-language-based system design  
- conversational reasoning models  
- long-form AI interaction patterns  

Always open to feedback, ideas, and collaboration.
